create:

category(selection input), date(specified user text input), amount(number input, could not be float), comment(text input)

edit:

?????what info user need to provide to locate the expense to be changed, the id may not make sense here?????need suggestion

user only need to provide the field that they want to edit, others are same to the 'create'page

listing:(only current day, week, month was proposed in proposal)

simple table listing, expect an array of searched result within time frame, default time frame should be TODAY, user could jump to other timframes with the links at the end of the page.

In the array, each object element should contain category, date, amount, comment fields.
